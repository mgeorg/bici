# Bici

These are the chirp files for programming BICI radios for coordinating the St. Louis bike group.

For 16 channel radios use the `bici_v2.csv` file (we recommend the Arcshell AR-15).  For radios with larger channel memories, such as the TidRadio H3 (Our recommendation for a more capable but still affordable radio), use the `base_200channel.csv` (which includes the Ghost Ride frequency marine channels and a number of local repeaters).  You will need licenses GMRS and Amateur Radio, to operate on many of these frequencies.
